 We report the discovery and analysis of only the third Lyman-limit system in
which a high-quality resolution, echelle spectrum reveals no metal absorption
lines, implying a metallicity $\lesssim$1/10000 solar. Our HIRES spectrum of
the background quasar, PSS1723$+$2243, provides a neutral hydrogen column
density range for LLS1723 of $N_\textrm{HI}=10^{\text{17.9--18.3}}$ cm$^{-2}$
at redshift $z_\textrm{abs}\approx4.391$. The lower bound on this range, and
the lack of detectable absorption from the strongest low-ionisation metal
lines, are combined in photoionisation models to infer a robust, conservative
upper limit on the metallicity: $\log(Z/Z_\odot)<-4.14$ at 95% confidence. Such
a low metallicity raises the question of LLS1723's origin and enrichment
history. Previous simulations of the circumgalactic medium imply that LLS1723
is a natural candidate for a cold gas stream accreting towards a galaxy.
Alternatively, LLS1723 may represent a high-density portion of the
intergalactic medium containing either pristine gas -- unpolluted by stellar
debris for 1.4 Gyr after the Big Bang -- or the remnants of low-energy
supernovae from (likely low-mass) Population III stars. Evidence for the
circumgalactic scenario could be obtained by mapping the environment around
LLS1723 with optical integral-field spectroscopy. The intergalactic
possibilities highlight the need for -- and opportunity to test -- simulations
of the frequency with which such high-density, very low-metallicity systems
arise in the intergalactic medium.

Title: Peak star formation efficiency and no missing baryons in massive spirals
Authors: Lorenzo Posti, Filippo Fraternali, Antonino Marasco (University of
 Groningen)

Comments: submitted
\\
 It is commonly believed that galaxies use, throughout the Hubble time, a very
small fraction of the baryons associated to their dark matter halos to form
stars. This so-called low "star formation efficiency" $f_\star\equiv
M_\star/f_{\rm b} M_{\rm halo}$, where $f_{\rm b}\equiv\Omega_{\rm
b}/\Omega_{\rm c}$ is the cosmological baryon fraction, is expected to reach
its peak at nearly $L^\ast$ (at efficiency $\approx 20\%$) and decline steeply
at lower and higher masses. We have tested this using a sample of nearby
star-forming galaxies, from dwarfs ($M_\star\simeq 10^7 M_\odot$) to high-mass
spirals ($M_\star\simeq 10^{11} M_\odot$) with HI rotation curves and 3.6$\mu$m
photometry. We fit the observed rotation curves with a Bayesian approach by
varying three parameters, stellar mass-to-light ratio $\Upsilon_\star$, halo
concentration $c$ and mass $M_{\rm halo}$. We found two surprising results: 1)
the star formation efficiency is a monotonically increasing function of
$M_\star$ with no sign of a decline at high masses, and 2) the most massive
spirals ($M_\star\simeq 1-3 \times 10^{11} M_\odot$) have $f_\star\approx
0.3-1$, i.e. they have turned nearly all the baryons associated to their haloes
into stars. These results imply that the most efficient galaxies at forming
stars are massive spirals (not $L^\ast$ galaxies), they reach nearly 100%
efficiency and thus, once their gas is also considered, they have virtually no
missing baryons. Moreover, there is no evidence of mass quenching of the star
formation occurring in galaxies up to halo masses of $M_{\rm halo}\approx {\rm
a\, few}\times 10^{12} M_\odot$.

 The Absorption Measure Distribution (AMD) in the X-ray outflows of Seyfert
galaxies describes the distribution of absorbing column density as a function
of ionization parameter. Up to now, AMD has been measured only for seven
objects with high resolution X-ray data that contain absorption lines from
ionized heavy elements. Even though the amount of known AMDs is not large, they
display universal broad shape with the existence of one prominent dip, for
which the absorbing column drops by around two orders of magnitude. In this
paper, we used the photoionization modelling to explain the overall AMD shape
in observed active galactic nuclei (AGN). In particular, we show that the AMD
shape depends both on: the spectral energy distribution (SED) of radiation
which enters the outflow, and the density of the warm absorber (WA). Our best
AMD model that closely reproduces the observed AMD shape is the one obtained
with the gas density of WA of the order of $10^{12}$ cm$^{-3}$, irradiated by
the SED with Opt/UV luminosity 100 times higher than the X-ray luminosity. When
the cloud density is high enough, free-free heating dominates the entire
absorber, and only one instability zone occurs, which is in agreement with
observations.

Title: A Review of Recent Observations of Galactic Winds Driven by Star
 Formation

Comments: Invited review for special issue "Theory and Observations of Galactic
 Outflows," ed. B. Husemann, D. Wylezalek, & I.-T. Ho

\\
 Galaxy-scale outflows of gas, or galactic winds (GWs), driven by energy from
star formation are a pivotal mechanism for regulation of star formation in the
current model of galaxy evolution. Observations of this phenomenon have
proliferated through the wide application of old techniques on large samples of
galaxies, the development of new methods, and advances in telescopes and
instrumentation. I review the diverse portfolio of direct observations of
stellar GWs since 2010. Maturing measurements of the ionized and neutral gas
properties of nearby winds have been joined by exciting new probes of molecular
gas and dust. Low-$z$ techniques have been newly applied in large numbers at
high $z$. The explosion of optical and near-infrared 3D imaging spectroscopy
has revealed the complex, multiphase structure of nearby GWs. These
observations point to stellar GWs being a common feature of rapidly
star-forming galaxies throughout at least the second half of cosmic history,
and suggest that scaling relationships between outflow and galaxy properties
persist over this period. The simple model of a modest-velocity, biconical flow
of multiphase gas and dust perpendicular to galaxy disks continues to be a
robust descriptor of these flows.

Title: On the slow quenching of M* galaxies: feeding the heart on the way to
 taming the beast

\\
 We investigate the connection between X-ray and radio-loud optically-obscured
AGNs and the physical properties of their evolved and massive host galaxies,
focussing on the mass-related quenching channel followed by $\mathcal{M}^\star
(\simeq 10^{10.6} M_\odot)$ galaxies in the rest-frame NUVrK colour diagram.
While our results confirm (1) radio-loud AGNs to be mostly hosted by
already-quenched and massive ($M_*>10^{11}M_\odot$) galaxies, ruling out their
feedback as primary driver of $\mathcal{M}^\star$ galaxy quenching, we found
(2) heavily-obscured X-ray AGNs to be mostly hosted by $\mathcal{M}^\star$
galaxies in the process of quenching. This argues for a quenching scenario that
enables mergers of (gas-poor) $\mathcal{M}^\star$ galaxies $after$ they have
left the star formation main sequence, i.e., after the onset of quenching
process. In that respect, we discuss how our results support a scenario where
the slow quenching of $\mathcal{M}^\star$ galaxies happens along cosmic
filaments.

Title: Spatial structure of the WMAP-Planck haze
Authors: G. Rubtsov, Y. Zhezher
Categories: astro-ph.GA
Comments: 7 pages, 10 figures
Report-no: INR-TH-2018-030
\\
 It was proposed that the two phenomena, WMAP-Planck haze and Fermi bubbles,
may have a common origin. In the present paper we analyze the spatial structure
of the haze using the Planck 2018 data release. It is found that the spatial
dimensions and locations of WMAP-Planck haze and Fermi bubbles are compatible
within the experimental uncertainties. No substructures similar to the Fermi
bubbles cocoon are identified in the Planck data. Comparison with the spatial
extent of possible synchrotron emission caused by the electron-positron pair
emitted by the Galactic center pulsar population and by the decay of dark
matter particles in the Galactic center region are performed. Both galactic
pulsars and dark matter decay remain viable explanations of the WMAP-Planck
haze.

Title: Compton-thick AGN in the NuSTAR era IV: A deep NuSTAR and XMM-Newton
 view of the candidate Compton thick AGN in ESO 116-G018
Authors: X. Zhao, S. Marchesi, M. Ajello
Categories: astro-ph.GA astro-ph.HE
Comments: 11 pages, 5 figures
\\
 We present the 2--78 keV spectral analysis of the deep NuSTAR and XMM-Newton
observation of a nearby Seyfert 2 galaxy, ESO 116-G018, which is selected as a
candidate Compton-thick (CT-) active galactic nucleus (AGN) based on a previous
Chandra-Swift/BAT study. Through our analysis, the source is for the first time
confirmed to be a CT-AGN at a $>$3 $\sigma$ confidence level, with the
'line-of-sight' column density N$_{\rm H,Z}$ = [2.46-2.76] $\times$ $10^{24}$
cm$^{-2}$. The 'global average' column density of the obscuring torus is
N$_{\rm H,S}$ = [0.46-0.62] $\times$ $10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$, which suggests a
clumpy, rather than uniform, distribution of the obscuring material surrounding
the accreting supermassive black hole. The excellent-quality data given by the
combined NuSTAR and XMM-Newton observations enable us to produce a strong
constraint on the covering factor of the torus of ESO 116-G018, which is found
to be $f_c$ = [0.13-0.15]. We also estimate the bolometric luminosity from the
broad-band X-ray spectrum, being L$\rm _{bol}$ = [2.57-3.41] $\times$ 10$^{44}$
erg s$^{-1}$.

\\
 Recent observations of giant ellipticals and brightest cluster galaxies
(BCGs) provide tentative evidence for a correlation between the luminosity of
the H$\alpha$ emitting gas filaments and the strength of feedback associated
with the active galactic nucleus (AGN). Motivated by this, we use 3D
radiation-hydrodynamic simulations with the code Enzo to examine and quantify
the relationship between the observable properties of the H$\alpha$ filaments
and the kinetic and radiative feedback from supermassive black holes in BCGs.
We find that the spatial extent and total mass of the filaments show positive
correlations with AGN feedback power and can therefore be used as probes of the
AGN activity. We also examine the relationship between the AGN feedback power
and velocity dispersion of the H$\alpha$ filaments and find that the kinetic
luminosity shows statistically significant correlation with the component of
the velocity dispersion along the jet axis but not the components perpendicular
to it.

Title: ALMA Observations of the Molecular Gas in the Elliptical Galaxy NGC3557
Authors: B. Vila-Vilaro, D. Espada, P. Cortes, S. Leon, E. Pompei, and J. Cepa
Categories: astro-ph.GA
\\
 We present the results of CO interferometric observations of the southern
elliptical galaxy NGC3557 with ALMA. We have detected both the CO(1-0) emission
line and a relatively strong continuum at 3mm. The continuum shows a
flat-spectrum central unresolved source (at our angular resolution of
0.7arcsec) and two jets, associated with the larger scale emission observed at
lower frequencies. The molecular gas in NGC3557 appears to be concentrated
within 250 pc of the center, and shows evidence of organized rotation along the
same axis as the stellar component and the symmetry axis of the nuclear dust
absorption reported in the literature. We obtained
M$_{H_2}$=(9.0$\pm$2.0)x10$^7$ M$_\odot$ of molecular gas, which has an average
CO(2-1) to CO(1-0) line ratio of 0.7, which is relatively high when compared
with the values reported in the literature for bona-fide ellipticals observed
with single-dish telescopes. NGC3557 shows further a high excitation peak
(i.e., CO(2-1)/CO(1-0) ~ 1.1$\pm$0.3 offset 0.7 arcsec from the center, which
appears to be associated with a region of higher velocity dispersion that does
not share the overall rotation pattern of the molecular gas, but aligned with
the radio jet. The molecular gas disk in this object appears to be stable to
local gravitational instabilities.

 Faraday rotation occurs along every line of sight in the Galaxy; Rotation
Measure (RM) synthesis allows a three-dimensional representation of the
interstellar magnetic field. This study uses data from the Global Magneto-Ionic
Medium Survey, a combination of single-antenna spectro-polarimetric studies,
including northern sky data from the DRAO 26-m Telescope (1270-1750 MHz) and
southern sky data from the Parkes 64-m Telescope (300-480 MHz). From the
synthesized Faraday spectral cubes we compute the zeroth, first, and second
moments to find the total polarized emission, mean and RM-width of the
polarized emission. From DRAO first moments we find a weak vertical field
directed from Galactic North to South, but Parkes data reveal fields directed
towards the Sun at high latitudes in both hemispheres: the two surveys clearly
sample different volumes. DRAO second moments show feature widths in Faraday
spectra increasing with decreasing positive latitudes, implying that longer
lines of sight encounter more Faraday rotating medium, but this is not seen at
negative latitudes. Parkes data show the opposite: at positive latitudes the
second moment decreases with decreasing latitude, but not at negative
latitudes. Comparing first moments with RMs of pulsars and extragalactic
sources and a study of depolarization together confirm that the DRAO survey
samples to larger distances than the Parkes data. Emission regions in the DRAO
survey are typically 700 to 1000 pc away, slightly beyond the scale-height of
the magneto-ionic medium; emission detected in the Parkes survey is entirely
within the magneto-ionic disk, less than 500 pc away.

 Methyl cyanide (CH3CN) and propyne (CH3CCH) are two molecules commonly used
as gas thermometers for interstellar gas. They are detected in several
astrophysical environments and in particular towards protostars. Using data of
the low-mass protostar IRAS 16293-2422 obtained with the IRAM 30m single-dish
telescope, we constrained the origin of these two molecules in the envelope of
the source. The line shape comparison and the results of a radiative transfer
analysis both indicate that the emission of CH3CN arises from a warmer and
inner region of the envelope than the CH3CCH emission. We compare the
observational results with the predictions of a gas-grain chemical model. Our
model predicts a peak abundance of CH3CCH in the gas-phase in the outer part of
the envelope, at around 2000 au from the central star, which is relatively
close to the emission size derived from the observations. The predicted CH3CN
abundance only rises at the radius where the grain mantle ices evaporate, with
an abundance similar to the one derived from the observations.

Title: Stellar mass spectrum within massive collapsing clumps III. Effects of
 temperature and magnetic field
Authors: Yueh-Ning Lee and Patrick Hennebelle
Categories: astro-ph.GA
\\
 The stellar mass spectrum is an important property of the stellar cluster and
a fundamental quantity to understand our Universe. The fragmentation of diffuse
molecular cloud into stars is subject to physical processes such as gravity,
turbulence, thermal pressure, and magnetic field. The final mass of a star is
believed to be a combined outcome of a virially unstable reservoir and
subsequent accretion. We aim to clarify the roles of different supporting
energies, notably the thermal pressure and the magnetic field, in determining
the stellar mass. Following previous studies by Lee & Hennebelle (2018a,b), we
perform a series of numerical experiments of stellar cluster formation inside
an isolated molecular clump. By changing the effective equation of state (EOS)
of the diffuse gas (that is to say gas whose density is below the critical
density at which dust becomes opaque to its radiation) and the strength of the
magnetic field, we investigate whether any characteristic mass is introduced
into the fragmentation processes. The EOS of the diffuse gas, including the
bulk temperature and the polytropic index, does not affect significantly the
shape of the stellar mass spectrum. The presence of magnetic field slightly
modifies the shape of the mass spectrum only when extreme values are applied.
This study confirms that the peak of the IMF is primarily determined by the
adiabatic high-density end of the EOS that mimics the radiation inside the
high-density gas. Furthermore, the shape of the mass spectrum is mostly
sensitive to the density PDF, and the magnetic field has likely only a
secondary role. In particular, we stress that the Jeans mass at the mean cloud
density and at the critical density are not responsible of setting the peak.

 We describe the methods used to construct the aligned-spin template bank of
gravitational waveforms used by the GstLAL-based inspiral pipeline to analyze
data from the second observing run of Advanced LIGO and Virgo. The bank expands
upon the parameter space covered during the first observing run, including
coverage for merging compact binary systems with total mass between 2
$\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ and 400 $\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ and mass ratios between 1 and
97.989. Thus the systems targeted include merging neutron star-neutron star
systems, neutron star-black hole binaries, and black hole-black hole binaries
expanding into the intermediate-mass range. Component masses less than 2
$\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ have allowed (anti-)aligned spins between $\pm0.05$ while
component masses greater than 2 $\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ have allowed
(anti-)aligned between $\pm0.999$. The bank placement technique combines a
stochastic method with a new grid-bank method to better isolate noisy
templates, resulting in a total of 677,000 templates.

\\
 Polarimetric interferometry is a method allowing the study of the
distribution of polarized flux at diffraction-limited resolution. Its basic
observable is the ratio $\mathcal{R}$ of the visibilities of the object in two
orthogonal polarizations. Here, we demonstrate how this observables can be
measured with the SPeckle Polarimeter (SPP) of the 2.5-m telescope. The SPP is
a combination of a dual-beam polarimeter and an EMCCD-based visible-range
speckle interferometer. We propose a simple method for the correction of
$\mathcal{R}$ for the instrumental polarization and polarization differential
aberrations of the telescope. The polarized intensity image can be estimated
from $\mathcal{R}$ under the assumption that the object is a point-like
unpolarized source plus a faint extended polarized envelope. The phase of
$\mathcal{R}$ can be used for measurement of the polaroastrometric signal - the
difference between the photocentres of orthogonally polarized images of the
object. We investigate both possibilities using observations of unpolarized
stars and stars with a significant polarized circumstellar environment -
$\mu$~Cep and RY~Tau.

Title: Characterization of Cameras for the COSMO K-Coronagraph
Authors: A.G. de Wijn
Categories: astro-ph.IM
DOI: 10.3847/1538-3881/aaedc0
\\
 Digital image sensors are ubiquitous in astronomical instrumentation and it
is well known that they suffer from issues that must be corrected for data to
be scientifically useful. I present discussion on errors resulting from
digitization and characterization of nonlinearity and ADC errors of the
PhotonFocus MV-D1024E cameras selected for the K-Coronagraph of the Coronal
Solar Magnetism Observatory. I derive an analytic expression for quantization
errors. The MV-D1024E camera has adequate bit depth for which quantization
error is not an issue. I show that this is not the case for all cameras,
particularly those with deep wells and low read noise. The impact of
nonlinearity and ADC errors on science observations of the K-Coronagraph is
analyzed using a simplified telescope model. Errors caused by the camera ADCs
result in systematic errors in the measurement of the polarimetric signal of
several times $10^{-9}~B_\odot$, which is about an order of magnitude above the
desired sensitivity. I demonstrate a method for post-facto data correction
using a lookup table and derive parameters from camera characterization
measurements that were made with a lab setup. Nonlinearity is traditionally
addressed with a global correction. I show through analysis of calibration data
that for the MV-D1024E this correction leaves residual systematic errors after
dark and gain correction of up to 1% of the signal. I demonstrate that a
pixel-wise correction of nonlinearity reduces the errors to below 0.1%. These
corrections are necessary for the K-Coronagraph data products to meet the
science requirements. They have been implemented in the instrument data
acquisition system and data reduction pipeline. While no other instruments
besides the K-Coronagraph or cameras besides the MV-D1024E are discussed here,
the results are illustrative for all instruments and cameras.

 Gravitational wave observatories have always been affected by tele-seismic
earthquakes leading to a decrease in duty cycle and coincident observation
time. In this analysis, we leverage the power of machine learning algorithms
and archival seismic data to predict the ground velocity and the state of the
gravitational wave interferometer during the event of an earthquake. We
demonstrate improvement from a factor of 5 to a factor of 2.5 in scatter of the
error in the predicted ground velocity over a previous model fitting based
approach. The level of accuracy achieved with this scheme makes it possible to
switch control configuration during periods of excessive ground motion thus
preventing the interferometer from losing lock. To further assess the accuracy
and utility of our approach, we use IRIS seismic network data and obtain
similar levels of agreement between the estimates and the measured amplitudes.
The performance indicates that such an archival or prediction scheme can be
extended beyond the realm of gravitational wave detector sites for hazard-based
early warning alerts.

 While gravitational waves have been detected from mergers of binary black
holes and binary neutron stars, signals from core collapse supernovae, the most
energetic explosions in the modern Universe, have not been detected yet. Here
we present a new method to analyse the data of the LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA
network to enhance the detection efficiency of this category of signals. The
method takes advantage of a peculiarity of the gravitational wave signal
emitted in the core collapse supernova and it is based on a classification
procedure of the time-frequency images of the network data performed by a
convolutional neural network trained to perform the task to recognize the
signal. We validate the method using phenomenological waveforms injected in
Gaussian noise whose spectral properties are those of the LIGO and Virgo
advanced detectors and we conclude that this method can identify the signal
better than the present algorithm devoted to select gravitational wave
transient signal.

 The science operations of the LISA Pathfinder mission has demonstrated the
feasibility of sub-femto-g free-fall of macroscopic test masses necessary to
build a LISA-like gravitational wave observatory in space. While the main focus
of interest, i.e. the optical axis or the $x$-axis, has been extensively
studied, it is also of interest to evaluate the stability of the spacecraft
with respect to all the other degrees of freedom. The current paper is
dedicated to such a study, with a focus set on an exhaustive and quantitative
evaluation of the imperfections and dynamical effects that impact the stability
with respect to its local geodesic. A model of the complete closed-loop system
provides a comprehensive understanding of each part of the in-loop coordinates
spectra. As will be presented, this model gives very good agreements with LISA
Pathfinder flight data. It allows one to identify the physical noise source at
the origin and the physical phenomena underlying the couplings. From this, the
performances of the stability of the spacecraft, with respect to its geodesic,
are extracted as a function of frequency. Close to $1 mHz$, the stability of
the spacecraft on the $X_{SC}$, $Y_{SC}$ and $Z_{SC}$ degrees of freedom is
shown to be of the order of $5.0\ 10^{-15} m\ s^{-2}/\sqrt{Hz}$ for X and $4.0
\ 10^{-14} m\ s^{-2}/\sqrt{Hz}$ for Y and Z. For the angular degrees of
freedom, the values are of the order $3\ 10^{-12} rad\ s^{-2}/\sqrt{Hz}$ for
$\Theta_{SC}$ and $3\ 10^{-13} rad\ s^{-2}/\sqrt{Hz}$ for $H_{SC}$ and
$\Phi_{SC}$.

 Detailed chemical abundances of Galactic stars are needed in order to improve
our knowledge of the formation and evolution of our galaxy, the Milky Way. We
took advantage of the GIANO archive spectra to select a sample of Galactic disc
stars in order to derive their chemical inventory and to compare the abundances
we derived from these infrared spectra to the chemical pattern derived from
optical spectra. We analysed high-quality spectra of 40 stars observed with
GIANO. We derived the stellar parameters from the photometry and the Gaia
data-release 2 (DR2) parallax; the chemical abundances were derived with the
code MyGIsFOS. For a subsample of stars we compared the chemical pattern
derived from the GIANO spectra with the abundances derived from optical
spectra. We derived P abundances for all 40 stars, increasing the number of
Galactic stars for which phosphorus abundance is known. We could derive
abundances of 14 elements, 8 of which are also derived from optical spectra.
The comparison of the abundances derived from infrared and optical spectra is
very good. The chemical pattern of these stars is the one expected for Galactic
disc stars and is in agreement with the results from the literature. GIANO is
providing the astronomical community with an extremely useful instrument, able
to produce spectra with high resolution and a wide wavelength range in the
infrared.

 We present 248 speckle observations of 43 binary and 19 trinary star systems
chosen to make progress in two main areas of investigation: the fundamental
properties of metal poor stars and star formation mechanisms. The observations
were taken at the Gemini North and South telescopes during the period 2015 July
to 2018 April, mainly with the Differential Speckle Survey Instrument (DSSI),
but also with a few early results from the new 'Alopeke speckle camera at
Gemini North. We find that the astrometry and photometry of these observations
as a whole are consistent with previous work at Gemini. We present five new
visual orbits for systems important in understanding metal-poor stars, three of
which have orbital periods of less than 4 years, and we indicate the degree to
which these and future observations can impact our knowledge of stellar
properties and star formation. In particular, we find a decrease in mass at
fixed spectral type for metal poor stars versus their solar-metallicity
analogues that is consistent with predictions that are made from current
stellar models.

Title: Effects of continuum fudging on non-LTE synthesis of stellar spectra. I.
 Effects on estimates of UV continua and Solar Spectral Irradiance variability
Authors: Serena Criscuoli
Categories: astro-ph.SR
Comments: Accepted in ApJ
\\
 Synthesis performed under non Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (non-LTE)
conditions usually overestimate stellar spectra. An approach widely adopted in
the literature to reduce the excess of UV radiation consists of artificially
increasing the continuum opacity by using multiplicative fudge factors, which
are empirically derived to impose the synthetized spectrum to match the
observed one. Although the method was initially developed to improve non-LTE
synthesis of spectral lines, it has been recently employed to model solar
spectral irradiance variability. Such irradiance reconstruction techniques
combine spectral synthesis of different types of structures, which are
performed making use of factors derived from a reference, quiet Sun model.
Because the opacity scales in a complex way with plasma physical properties,
the question arises whether, and to what extent, fudge factors derived using a
reference model can be used to adjust the opacity of models representing
different types of quiet and magnetic features. Here we investigate the effects
of opacity fudging on estimates of solar and stellar irradiance variability in
UV bands. We find that the use of fudge factors might underestimate the
variability by 19% and up to 20% in the ranges 230-300 nm and 300-400 nm,
respectively. These estimates are model dependent and should be considered as
upper limits. Finally, our analysis suggests the uncertainties generated by the
use of fudge factors to increase with the decrease of stellar metallicity and
to be significant for stars whose variability is facula-dominated and whose
effective temperature is larger than approximately 4000 K.

 The problem of solar chromospheric heating remains a challenging one with
wider implications for stellar physics. Several studies in the recent past have
shown that small-scale inclined magnetic field elements channel copious amount
of energetic low-frequency acoustic waves, that are normally trapped below the
photosphere. These magneto-acoustic waves are expected to shock at
chromospheric heights contributing to chromospheric heating. In this work,
exploiting simultaneous photospheric vector magnetic field, Doppler, continuum
and line-core intensity (of FeI 6173 {\AA}) observations from the Helioseismic
and Magnetic Imager (HMI) and lower-atmospheric UV emission maps in the 1700
{\AA} and 1600 {\AA} channels of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA), both
onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) of NASA, we revisit the
relationships between magnetic field properties (inclination and strength) and
the acoustic wave propagation (phase travel time). We find that the flux of
acoustic energy, in the 2 - 5 mHz frequency range, between the upper
photosphere and lower chromosphere is in the range of 2.25 - 2.6 kW m$^{-2}$,
which is about twice the previous estimates. We identify that the relatively
less-inclined magnetic field elements in the quiet-Sun channel a significant
amount of waves of frequency lower than the theoretical minimum for acoustic
cut-off frequency due to magnetic inclination. We also derive indications that
these waves steepen and start to dissipate within the heights ranges probed,
while those let out due to inclined magnetic fields pass through. We explore
connections with existing theoretical and numerical results that could explain
the origin of these waves.

 We present the analysis of the Blazhko effect - quasi-periodic modulation of
pulsation amplitude and/or phase - in the Galactic bulge first overtone RR
Lyrae stars (RRc). We used the data gathered during the fourth phase of the
Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE). Out of 10 826 analyzed RRc
stars, Blazhko effect was detected in 607 stars which constitute 5.6 percent of
the sample. It is the largest and most homogeneous sample of modulated RRc
stars analyzed so far. Modulation periods cover a wide range, from slightly
above 2 d to nearly 3000 d. Multiperiodic modulation was detected in 47 stars.
The appearance of modulation in the frequency domain was studied in detail.
Modulation manifests either as close doublets or as equidistant triplets and
multiplets centered on radial mode frequency and its harmonics. In a
significant fraction (29 percent) of stars, we have detected the modulation
frequency itself, which corresponds to the modulation of the mean stellar
brightness. Our search for period doubling effect, that was discovered recently
in modulated fundamental mode RR Lyrae stars, and triggered development of new
model behind the Blazhko modulation, yielded negative result. In 104 stars we
detected additional signals that could correspond to both radial and non-radial
modes. Statistical properties of modulated stars were analyzed in detail and
confronted with properties of non-modulated stars and of modulated fundamental
mode RR Lyrae stars. Our analysis provides constraints for the models to
explain the Blazhko phenomenon, which still remains a puzzle more than hundred
years after its discovery.

 The Arches is one of the youngest, densest and most massive clusters in the
Galaxy. As such it provides a unique insight into the lifecycle of the most
massive stars known and the formation and survival of such stellar aggregates
in the extreme conditions of the Galactic Centre. In a previous study we
presented an initial stellar census for the Arches and in this work we expand
upon this, providing new and revised classifications for ~30% of the 105
spectroscopically identified cluster members as well as distinguishing
potential massive runaways. The results of this survey emphasise the
homogeneity and apparent co-evality of the Arches and confirm the absence of
H-free Wolf-Rayets of WC sub-type and predicted luminosities. The increased
depth of our complete dataset also provides significantly better constraints on
the main sequence population; with the identification of O9.5 V stars for the
first time we now spectroscopically sample stars with initial masses ranging
from ~16Msun to >120Msun. Indeed, following from our expanded stellar census we
might expect >50 stars within the Arches to have been born with masses >60Msun,
while all 105 spectroscopically confirmed cluster members are massive enough to
leave relativistic remnants upon their demise. Moreover the well defined
observational properties of the main sequence cohort will be critical to the
construction of an extinction law appropriate for the Galactic Centre and
consequently the quantitative analysis of the Arches population and subsequent
determination of the cluster initial mass function.

Title: Dispersion of small magnetic elements inside active regions on the Sun
Authors: Valentina I. Abramenko
Categories: astro-ph.SR
Comments: Published by MNRAS
DOI: 10.1093/mnras/sty1964
\\
 A process of diffusion of small-scale magnetic elements inside four active
regions (ARs) was analyzed. Line-of-sight magnetograms acquired by the
Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard the Solar Dynamic Observatory
(SDO) during a two-day time interval around the AR culmination time were
utilized. Small magnetic elements of size of 3-100 squared HMI pixels with the
field strength above the detection threshold of 30 Mx cm$^{-2}$ were detected
and tracked. The turbulent diffusion coefficient was retrieved using the
pair-separation technique. Comparison with the previously reported quiet-sun
(QS) diffusivity was performed. It was found that: i) dispersion of small-scale
magnetic elements inside the AR area occurs in the regime close to normal
diffusion, whereas well-pronounced super-diffusion is observed in QS; ii) the
diffusivity regime operating in an AR (the magnitude of the spectral index and
the range of the diffusion coefficient) does not seem to depend on the
individual properties of an AR, such as total unsigned magnetic flux, state of
evolution, and flaring activity. We conclude that small-scale magnetic elements
inside an AR do not represent an undisturbed photosphere, but they rather are
intrinsic part of the whole coherent magnetic structure forming an active
region. Moreover, turbulence of small-scale elements in an AR is not closely
related to processes above the photosphere, but it rather carries the footprint
of the sub-photospheric dynamics.

 We present interferometric observations of six O-type stars that were made
with the Precision Astronomical Visible Observations (PAVO) beam combiner at
the Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy (CHARA) Array. The
observations include multiple brackets for three targets, $\lambda$~Ori~A,
$\zeta$~Oph, and 10~Lac, but there are only preliminary, single observations of
the other three stars, $\xi$~Per, $\alpha$~Cam, and $\zeta$~Ori~A. The stellar
angular diameters range from 0.55 milliarcsec for $\zeta$~Ori~A down to 0.11
mas for 10~Lac, the smallest star yet resolved with the CHARA Array. The
rotational oblateness of the rapidly rotating star $\zeta$ Oph is directly
measured for the first time. We assembled ultraviolet to infrared flux
measurements for these stars, and then derived angular diameters and reddening
estimates using model atmospheres and an effective temperature set by published
results from analysis of the line spectrum. The model-based angular diameters
are in good agreement with observed angular diameters. We also present
estimates for the effective temperatures of these stars derived by setting the
interferometric angular size and fitting the spectrophotometry.

 Solar-Stellar Activity Observations

Comments: 5 pages, 4 figures; submitted
\\
 Long-term solar magnetic activity reconstructions indicate the solar dynamo
operates in two distinct -- grand minimum and regular activity -- modes. By
employing bifurcation analysis of a reduced dynamo model we establish this to
be a consequence of dynamo hysteresis. We reproduce the observed bimodal
distribution of sunspots, but only for subcritical dynamos. A theoretical
framework consistent with this finding explains observations of an abrupt
midlife transition in stellar activity, characterized by reduced angular
momentum loss rates and breakdown of gyrochronology relations. Our study
indicates that an evolving dynamo bridges a diversity of phenomena in
solar-like stars across their lifetime.

 Extended MS turn-offs are features commonly found in the colour-magnitude
diagrams of young and intermediate age (less than about 2 Gyr) massive star
clusters, where the MS turn-off is broader than can be explained by photometric
uncertainties, crowding, or binarity. Rotation is suspected to be the cause of
this feature, by accumulating fast rotating stars, strongly affected by gravity
darkening and rotation-induced mixing, near the MS turn-off. This scenario
successfully reproduces the tight relation between the age and the actual
extent in luminosity of the extended MS turn-off of observed clusters. Below a
given mass (dependent on the metallicity), stars are efficiently braked early
on the MS due to the interaction of stellar winds and the surface magnetic
field, making their tracks converge towards those of non-rotating tracks in the
HRD. When these stars are located at the turn-off of a cluster, their slow
rotation causes the extended MS turn-off feature to disappear. We investigate
the maximal mass for which this braking occurs at different metallicities, and
determine the age above which no extended MS turn-off is expected in clusters.
Our models predict that the extended MS turn-off phenomenon disappears at ages
older than about 2 Gyr. There is a trend with the metallicity, the age at which
the disappearance occurs becoming older at higher metallicity. These results
are robust between the two codes used in this work, despite some differences in
the input physics and in particular in the detailed description of
rotation-induced internal processes and of angular momentum extraction by
stellar winds. Comparing our results with clusters in the LMC and Galaxy shows
a very good fit to the observations. This strengthens the rotation scenario to
explain the cause of the extended MS turn-off phenomenon.

 Rate

 Mordasini, and Alexandre Emsenhuber
Categories: astro-ph.SR
Comments: 16 pages, 10 figures
\\
 The orbital distribution of giant planets is crucial for understanding how
terrestrial planets form and predicting yields of exoplanet surveys. Here, we
derive giant planets occurrence rates as a function of orbital period by taking
into account the detection efficiency of the Kepler and radial velocity (RV)
surveys. The giant planet occurrence rates for Kepler and RV show the same
rising trend with increasing distance from the star. We identify a break in the
RV giant planet distribution between ~2-3 au | close to the location of the
snow line in the Solar System | after which the occurrence rate decreases with
distance from the star. Extrapolating a broken power-law distribution to larger
radii, we find good agreement with the ~ 1% planet occurrence rates from direct
imaging surveys. Assuming a symmetric power law, we also estimate that the
occurrence of giant planets between 0.1-100 au is 26.6 +7.5 -5.4% for planets
with masses 0.1-20MJ and decreases to 6.2 +1.5 -1.2% for planets more massive
than Jupiter. This implies that only a fraction of the structures detected in
disks around young stars can be attributed to giant planets. Various planet
population synthesis models show good agreement with the observed distribution,
and we show how a quantitative comparison between model and data can be used to
constrain planet formation and migration mechanisms.

Title: Simulations of the merging cluster of galaxies Cygnus A

Categories: astro-ph.HE astro-ph.GA
DOI: 10.1093/mnras/sty3385
\\
 The archetype FR-II galaxy Cygnus A lies in a moderately rich cluster about
to undergo a major merger. We study the pre-merger Cygnus cluster environment
using smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations constrained by 2Ms of Chandra
observations of the hot intracluster medium. The observations constrain the
total gravitating mass and concentration parameter, and the simulations provide
the quiescent and merger-enhanced temperature profiles of the pre- and post
merger of the cluster excluding the central active galactic nucleus. We present
the first detailed model of the sub cluster north west of Cygnus A, named
CygNW. We find a lower baryon fraction and higher concentration parameter for
CygA than expected from known scaling relations in the literature. The model
suggests the Cygnus cluster hosts a pre-merger with a progenitor mass ratio of
about 1.5:1 at the virial radius. We notice that the intra cluster medium is
heated as a result of the merger, but we find no evidence for a (pre-)merger
shock in the interstitial region between both cluster haloes. We attribute the
merger-induced heating to compression of the cluster outskirts. The smooth
model obtained from our simulations is subtracted from the observed cluster
state and shows residual temperature structure that is neither hydrostatic nor
merger-heated cluster gas. We speculate that this residual heating may result
from previous AGN activity over the last ~100 Myr.

Title: Explicit Bayesian treatment of unknown foreground contaminations in
 galaxy surveys
Authors: Natalia Porqueres, Doogesh Kodi Ramanah, Jens Jasche, Guilhem Lavaux
Categories: astro-ph.CO astro-ph.IM
\\
 The treatment of unknown foreground contaminations will be one of the major
challenges for galaxy clustering analyses of coming decadal surveys. These data
contaminations introduce erroneous large-scale effects in recovered power
spectra and inferred dark matter density fields. In this work, we present an
effective solution to this problem in terms of a robust likelihood designed to
account for effects due to unknown foreground and target contaminations.
Conceptually, this robust likelihood marginalizes over the unknown large-scale
contamination amplitudes. We showcase the effectiveness of this novel
likelihood via an application to a mock SDSS-III data set subject to dust
extinction contamination. In order to illustrate the performance of our
proposed likelihood, we infer the underlying dark matter density field and
reconstruct the matter power spectrum while being maximally agnostic about the
foregrounds. These results are contrasted to an analysis with a standard
Poissonian likelihood, as typically used in modern large-scale structure
analyses. While the standard Poissonian analysis yields excessive power for
large-scale modes and introduces an overall bias in the power spectrum, our
likelihood provides unbiased estimates of the matter power spectrum over the
entire range of Fourier modes considered in this work. Further, we demonstrate
that our approach accurately accounts for and corrects effects of unknown
foreground contaminations when inferring three-dimensional density fields.
Robust likelihood approaches, as presented in this work, will be crucial to
control unknown systematics and maximize the outcome of the decadal surveys.

detectors such as Advanced LIGO and Virgo is mission critical for the success
of gravitational-wave astrophysics. Gravitational-wave detectors are sensitive
to a variety of disturbances of non-astrophysical origin with characteristic
frequencies in the instrument band of sensitivity. Removing non-astrophysical
artifacts that corrupt the data stream is crucial for increasing the number and
statistical significance of gravitational-wave detections and enabling refined
astrophysical interpretations of the data. Machine learning has proved to be a
powerful tool for analysis of massive quantities of complex data in astronomy
and related fields of study. We present two machine learning methods, based on
random forest and genetic programming algorithms, that can be used to determine
the origin of non-astrophysical transients in the LIGO detectors. We use two
classes of transients with known instrumental origin that were identified
during the first observing run of Advanced LIGO to show that the algorithms can
successfully identify the origin of non-astrophysical transients in real
interferometric data and thus assist in the mitigation of instrumental and
environmental disturbances in gravitational-wave searches. While the data sets
described in this paper are specific to LIGO, and the exact procedures employed
were unique to the same, the random forest and genetic programming code bases
and means by which they were applied as a dual machine learning approach are
completely portable to any number of instruments in which noise is believed to
be generated through mechanical couplings, the source of which is not yet
discovered.

Title: Cosmology-marginalized approaches in Bayesian model comparison: the
 neutrino mass as a case study
Authors: S. Gariazzo, O. Mena
Categories: astro-ph.CO astro-ph.IM hep-ph physics.data-an
Comments: 6 pages, 1 table, 2 figures
\\
 We propose here a \emph{novel} method which singles out the \emph{a priori}
unavoidable dependence on the underlying cosmological model when extracting
parameter constraints, providing robust limits which only depend on the
considered dataset. Interestingly, when dealing with several possible
cosmologies and interpreting the Bayesian preference in terms of the Gaussian
statistical evidence, the preferred model is much less favored than when only
two cases are compared. As a working example, we apply our approach to the
cosmological neutrino mass bounds, which play a fundamental role not only in
establishing the contribution of relic neutrinos to the dark matter of the
Universe, but also in the planning of future experimental searches of the
neutrino character and of the neutrino mass ordering.

Title: Optimising observing strategies for monitoring animals using
 drone-mounted thermal infrared cameras

Comments: Accepted for publication in International Journal of Remote Sensing:
 Drones. 30 pages, 13 figures
\\
 The proliferation of relatively affordable off-the-shelf drones offers great
opportunities for wildlife monitoring and conservation. Similarly the recent
reduction in cost of thermal infrared cameras also offers new promise in this
field, as they have the advantage over conventional RGB cameras of being able
to distinguish animals based on their body heat and being able to detect
animals at night. However, the use of drone-mounted thermal infrared cameras
comes with several technical challenges. In this paper we address some of these
issues, namely thermal contrast problems due to heat from the ground,
absorption and emission of thermal infrared radiation by the atmosphere,
obscuration by vegetation, and optimizing the flying height of drones for a
best balance between covering a large area and being able to accurately image
and identify animals of interest. We demonstrate the application of these
methods with a case study using field data, and make the first ever detection
of the critically endangered riverine rabbit (Bunolagus monticularis) in
thermal infrared data. We provide a web-tool so that the community can easily
apply these techniques to other studies

 GJ 3470b is a warm Neptune transiting an M-dwarf star at the edge of the
evaporation desert. It offers the possibility of investigating how low-mass,
close-in exoplanets evolve under the irradiation from their host stars. We
observed three transits of GJ 3470b in the Lyman-alpha line with the Hubble
Space Telescope (HST) as part of the Panchromatic Comparative Exoplanet
Treasury (PanCET) program. Absorption signatures are detected with similar
properties in all three independent epochs, with absorption depths of 35+-7% in
the blue wing of the line, and 23+-5% in the red wing. The repeatability of
these signatures, their phasing with the planet transit, and the radial
velocity of the absorbing gas allow us to conclude that there is an extended
upper atmosphere of neutral hydrogen around GJ 3470 b. We determine from our
observations the stellar radiation pressure and XUV irradiation from GJ 3470
and use them to perform numerical simulations of the upper atmosphere of GJ
3470b with the EVaporating Exoplanets (EVE) code. The unusual redshifted
signature can be explained by the damping wings of dense layers of neutral
hydrogen that extend beyond the Roche lobe and are elongated in the direction
of the planet motion. This structure could correspond to a shocked layer of
planetary material formed by the collision of the expanding thermosphere with
the wind of the star. The blueshifted signature is well explained by neutral
hydrogen atoms escaping at rates of about 1e10 g s-1 that are blown away from
the star by its strong radiation pressure and are quickly photoionized,
resulting in a smaller exosphere than that of the warm Neptune GJ 436b. The
stronger escape from GJ 3470b, however, may have led to the loss of about 4-35%
of its current mass over its 2 Gyr lifetime.
